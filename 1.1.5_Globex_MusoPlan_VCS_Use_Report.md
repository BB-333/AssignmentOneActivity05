VCS Use and Management


- DIFFICULTIES OR CHALLENGES OF GITHUB USE

        Several merges from the Reports branch were used as test cases to ensure the process followed was correct. Testing of the merging process allowed me to see that merging with MAIN on the LOCAL REPO before pushing to the REMOTE led to the REMOTE branch being 'behind' by a number of commits. 
        This was corrected by pushing the commits from the LOCAL to the REMOTE using the command 'git push origin Reports' resulting in the MAIN and REPORTS being even in the numner of commits received.
        This also demonstrated that I would need to use the command 'git push origin branchname' for all pushes to the remote repo to ensure the project adhered to the organsational requirements of the main staying clean until the final commit


- ORGANISATIONAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE VCS

        1. All development and report writing was implemented on feature branches..

        2. All commit messages were written as if giving an instruction. 
                For example: "Add the MeetingMinutes.txt file."

        3. The scope of each commit made were singular changes to the documents and files.
                For example: "Add the Report.docx file." was followed by "Update Report.docx file to include Classes and Methods outline."

        4. The name and email of the author was recorded at intialisation to show on each action.

        5. The project repository was initialised and cloned from the remote repository with only a README.md file included, all other files and documents were added following the initialisation and cloning process. 


- VERIFYING THE PERFORMANCE OF THE VCS

        BRANCHES 
                Using the 'git checkout -b branchname' command to create and switch to the new branch, then using 'git push origin branch-name' to push the new branch to the remote repo, this also pushed any committed changes on that branch to the remote repo.
                To verify this process I used the GitHub account where the repo was created to check if the new branch was pushed and if any commits were also received.

        STAGES
                To verify the staging of any commits I used the command 'git status' following 'git add filename.extension'. The message shown here:
                        $ git status
                        On branch Reports
                        Changes to be committed:
                                (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
                                        new file:   1.1.1_Globex_MusoPlan_Report.docx
                This confirms that a file/changes are prepared to be committed.

        COMMITS
                To verify if a commit comand has performed as expected a message should be display these details:
                        $ git commit -m "Message."
                        [Branch name] 
                        filename.extension
                I check if the numbers of files changes, insertions and deletions correspond to the changes made prior to committing before pushing the changes to the remote.

        MERGES
                To verify if a merge has been successful I checked the message following a merge similar to the following:
                        $ git merge Branchname
                        files included in merge 
                        number of changes, insertions and deletions
                        
                NOTE: a Fast-forward notation on a merge indicates here that the main is ahead in commits than the branch merged from. This was corrected by returning to the LOCAL and pushing from the branch which was behind in commits.
        
        PUSH 
                Pushing from the main or a branch was completed on a number of occasions to test the process and familiarise with the commands. See details above.

        COMMIT LOG
                The commit log was used to view which changes had already been committed and ensure the updates I was making were not duplicated. To view the commit history, the command 'git log' was used and produces a list of commits in descending order.

        PULL REQUESTS 
                Pull requests were used after forking from another repository, cloning the repository to the local, creating a new branch, adding new files, committing and then sending a pull request to the central repository owner. This included naming and describing the contents of the pull request changes and waiting for acceptance from the owner.
